            <div class="step-detail">
                <h3>1. Earn a relevant degree to what you want to instruct</h3>
                <p>Colleges and universities expect instructors to have at least a bachelor's degree in the subject they want to teach. For example, if you want to teach literature, you should have a Bachelor of Arts in English. Many schools prefer candidates with master's degrees, and even if they don’t, it’s well worth it to pursue one. A master’s degree can help you stand out among potential hires and make you eligible for salary increases and promotions. If you plan on earning tenure or want to participate in academic research, you’ll need to earn your doctorate after completing your bachelor’s and master’s degrees.</p>
                <p><strong>What type of degree should you pursue to become an Instructor?</strong></p>
                <p>76% of people working as an Instructor earned a Bachelor's Degree</p>
                <p><strong>What skills do you need to be an Instructor?</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Teaching Experience</li>
                    <li>Excellent Communication</li>
                    <li>CPR / First Aid</li>
                    <li>VMWare ESXi</li>
                    <li>Windows Server 2012</li>
                    <li>Microsoft Office Suite</li>
                    <li>English</li>
                    <li>Coding</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <div class="step-detail">
                <h3>2. Apply for teaching assistant positions</h3>
                <p>While completing your degree, you should apply for teaching assistant (TA) positions at your college, which can give you practical experience and look good on your resume. Undergrad TAs typically assist professors with grading papers and proctoring exams. If you work as a TA in grad school, you can expect to teach classes, work with students in lab settings, and assist the professor with research.</p>

                <h3>3. Apply for instructor positions</h3>
                <p>After you’ve earned your degree and gained experience as a TA, it’s time to apply for instructor jobs. It’s not uncommon for instructors to start in entry-level positions like adjunct instructor or assistant instructor, so don’t get discouraged if you don’t land your dream job right away. These positions will allow you to hone your skills and get further acclimated to a classroom setting.</p>

                <h3>4. Continue to develop your career skills by joining organizations, such as the AAUP</h3>
                <p>No matter where you are in your career as an instructor, there’s always room to grow and develop your career skills. Joining a professional organization such as the American Association of University Professors (AAUP) will give you access to resources to help you handle issues that instructors face in an ever-changing world.</p>
                <p>Groups like AAUP also hold conferences and other events where you can expand your professional network, meeting other instructors and education professionals who may lead you to other instructor opportunities. You should also apply for committee positions at your college for opportunities to collaborate with other faculty members.</p>
